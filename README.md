# Forking Vs Cloning

If you want to make a copy of an existing repo and maybe push to it in future (great for showing contribs to public projects / codebase) try forking instead of cloning.

Forking keeps a reference to the origin, but migrates a project to your workspace (you become the owner). Cloning keeps the original owner; you can't push or pull to that repo without access.

Technically you can't push changes directly to a forked repo's origin either, but you CAN pull from their master and keep workin on your own project - create branches, merge to your own master branch etc.

It's good to know the difference and when to use each option.
